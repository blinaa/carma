0. The script uses CaRMa HTTP API for reading and updating the DB.
CaRMa /_/ routes must be accessible from the localhost. RU.txt needs
to be present in the script directory for zip code recognition.

Make sure CARMA_PARTNER_PUT in carma-http.awk matches the present
setup (most importantly, CaRMa port number).

1. geofix.sh writes geofix-****.result.txt file:

    bash geofix.sh

Examine .log for anomalies.    

2. Result file is processed by carma-http.awk into a list of curl
invokation lines.

    awk -f carma-http.awk geofix-FXul8c.result.txt > result-commands

3. Finally, perform all the queries.

    cat result-commands | parallel -j4

       or simply
    
    bash result-commands

F. Test if it works:

    curl localhost:8000/geo/partners/37.66,55.87/34.66,50/

    must return a list of partners within a rectangle defined by two
    opposite points given in the request.
